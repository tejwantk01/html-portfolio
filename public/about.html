<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Tejwant Khangura. I am a fourth-year health science student currently studying at Simon Fraser University. 
  I have found a passion for coding after completing the Harvard CS50 course by David Malan. This passion arose when I 
  realized that I could not spend the rest of my life working a 9-5 for a company. I would have pursued a degree but after 
  completing approximately four years in another faculty, I thought it would be better to take these free bootcamps and 
  courses to learn the basics.

  Although I enjoy coding, I also have other hobbies. Some of which are playing for a commmunity soccer team, going to the 
  gym as much as I can (I go 2 days a week at most even when I'm free), and playing video games with my friends at night. These
  hobbies keep me engaged in life and in check to make sure I do the things I love.

  With the help of this course, I want to open a business where I create websites that have very cool designs for local businesses.
  I know this will take a lot of work and dedication, but I picture myself enjoying a pina colada on some random beach in some 
  random place in the world, developing my clients' websites. As much as I have seen hard work first hand from my parents and my sisters, 
  my one goal in life is to visit as much of the world as I can and take pictures of the most fascinating things in life and share it with
  everyone because life is beautiful. And since you only live once, why not enjoy it.

  If you read all of this, I wish you the best in your journey and if you skipped to here without reading the rest, I still wish you the 
  best in your journey. A huge shoutout to David Malan and Angela Yu.
